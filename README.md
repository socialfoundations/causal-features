# Predictors from causal features do not generalize better to new domains

This is code to reproduce experiments in the paper:

> "Predictors from causal features do not generalize better to new domains"

## Quickstart
<!-- We adapt the setup for a conda environment provided by TableShift. -->
Simply clone the repo, enter the root directory and create a local conda environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/socialfoundations/causal-features.git
# set up the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Run the following commands to test the local execution environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tableshift
# test the install by running the training script
python examples/run_expt.py
```
The final line above will print some detailed logging output as the script executes. When you see `training completed! test accuracy: 0.6221` your environment is ready to go! (Accuracy may vary slightly due to randomness.)

## Reproducing the experiments in the paper

The training script we run is located at `experiments_causal/run_experiment.py`.
It takes the following arguments:
* `experiment` (experiment to run)
* `model` (model to use)
* `cache_dir` (directory to cache raw data files to)
* `save_dir` (directory to save result files to)
  
The full list of model names is given below. For more details on each algorithm, see TableShift.
| Model                 | Name in TableShift |

| XGBoost               | `xgb`              |
| LightGBM              | `lightgbm`         |

All experiments were run as jobs submitted to a centralized cluster, running the open-source HTCondor scheduler.
The relevant script launching the jobs is located at `experiments_causal/launch_experiments.py`.

### Raw results of experiments
We provide the raw results of our experiments in the folder `experiments_causal/results/`. They contain a single `json` file for each task, feature selection and trained model.

## Reproducing the figures in the paper
Use the following Python scripts:
- Main result:
  - Figure in introduction: `experiments_causal/plot_paper_introduction_figure.py`
  - Figures in section "Empirical results": `experiments_causal/plot_paper_figures.py`
- Appendix: `experiments_causal/plot_paper_appendix_figures.py`, `experiments_causal/plot_paper_appendix_figures_extra.py`, and `experiments_causal/plot_paper_appendix_figures_extra2.py`

## Dataset Availability

The datasets in our paper are either publicly available, or provide open credentialized access.
The datasets with open credentialized access require signing a data use agreement. For the tasks `ICU Mortality` and `ICU Length of Stay`, it is required to complete  training CITI Data or Specimens Only Research, as they contain sensitive personal information.
Hence, these datasets must be manually fetched and stored locally.

A list of datasets, their names in our code, and the corresponding access levels are below. The string identifier is the value that should be passed as the `experiment` parameter to the `--experiment` flag of `experiments_causal/run_experiment.py`.
The causal, arguably causal, and anti-causal feature sets are obtained by appending `_causal`, `_arguablycausal` and `_anticausal` to the string identifier.

TableShift includes the preprocessing of the data files in their implementation. For the tasks `Utilization` and `Poverty`, follow the instructions provided by [Hardt & Kim (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3617694.3623225) in `backward_predictor/README.md`.

## Differences to TableShift
We list in the following which files/folders we changed for our experiments:
- created folder `experiments_causal` with python scripts to run experiments, launch experiments on a cluster, and plot figures for the paper
- created folder `backward_prediction` with preprocessing files adapted from [Hardt & Kim (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3617694.3623225) with `backward_predictor/sipp/data/data_cleaning.ipynb` &copy; Ricardo Sandoval, 2024
- added tasks `meps` and `sipp`, as well as causal feature selections of all tasks in their respective Python scripts in the folder `tableshift/datasets`
- added data source for `meps` and `sipp` in `tableshift/core/data_source.py`
- added tasks `meps` and `sipp`, as well as causal feature selection of all tasks in `tableshift/core/tasks.py`
- added configurations for tasks and their causal feature selections in `tableshift/configs/non_benchmark_configs.py`
- added computation of balanced accuracy in `tableshift/models/torchutils.py` and adapted `tableshift/models/compat.py` accordingly
- minor fixes in `tableshift/core/features.py`, `tableshift/core/tabular_dataset.py` and `tableshift/models/training.py`
- added the packages `paretoset==1.2.3` and `seaborn==0.13.0` in `requirements.txt`
